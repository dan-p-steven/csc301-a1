Generative A1 Usage Statement:
We utilized generative AI (claude) to accelerate the developement of the Inter-Service Communication Service and the Workload Parser.
Specifically, we prompted the AI to generate the boilerplate code for the com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer setup and the java.net.HttpURLConnection logic.
This ensured we adherehed to the constraints of using standard Java libraries without explicitly requiring external HTTP clients.

While the AI provided a functional skeleton, we made significant manual modifications to ensure compatibility with the lab environment and assignment quirks.
The AI generate parser did not account for the specific formatting inconsistencies in the combinedWorkload.txt. 
We manually implemented logic to check the parts.length of the input string and handle dynamic argument shifting to prevent ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exceptions.
