Generative A1 Usage Statement:
We utilized generative AI (claude) to accelerate the developement of the Inter-Service Communication Service and the Workload Parser.
Specifically, we prompted the AI to generate the boilerplate code for the com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer setup and the java.net.HttpURLConnection logic.
This ensured we adherehed to the constraints of using standard Java libraries without explicitly requiring external HTTP clients.

While the AI provided a functional skeleton, we made significant manual modifications to ensure compatibility with the lab environment and assignment quirks.
The AI generate parser did not account for the specific formatting inconsistencies in the combinedWorkload.txt. 
We manually implemented logic to check the parts.length of the input string and handle dynamic argument shifting to prevent ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exceptions.


Shortcuts and Scalability:

ISCS:
For assignment 1, the service reads a single IP and port for the User and Product services from config.json, and forwards traffic 1 to 1.
It effectively acts as a pipe, copying the request method, headers, and body to the destination and relaying the response back.

The current implementation assumes a single instance of every backend service. In assignment 2, we expect to scale to around 10,000 users,
requiring multiple instances of the User and Product services to handle the load. A pass-through cannot distribute traffic amoung these multiple. 
It would bottleneck on a singular instance.

We will rewrite the ForwardHandler login in ISCS.java. Instead of loading a single ServerConfig object, the configuarate parser will need to
accept a list of availible IP/Port pairs. We will
